                <dd>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to
                    more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute
                    Respiratory
                    Syndrome (SARS-CoV).
                    The novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.
                    Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                    Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover
                    without
                    special treatment.
                    Although for most people COVID-19 causes only mild illness, it can make some people very ill. More
                    rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre- existing medical conditions
                    (such as
                    high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable.
                    The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected
                    person
                    coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on
                    floors
                    or surfaces.
                    You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has
                    COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.
                    <h3>How does the new coronavirus spread?</h3>
                    As of now, researchers know that the new coronavirus is spread through droplets released into the
                    air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The droplets generally do not travel more than a few
                    feet, and they fall to the ground (or onto surfaces) in a few seconds â€” this is why physical
                    distancing is effective in preventing the spread.

                    <h3>How did this new coronavirus spread to humans?</h3>
                    COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, a city in China, in December 2019. Although health officials are still
                    tracing the exact source of this new coronavirus, early hypotheses thought it may be linked to a
                    seafood market in Wuhan, China. Some people who visited the market developed viral pneumonia caused
                    by the new coronavirus. A study that came out on Jan. 25, 2020, notes that the individual with the
                    first reported case became ill on Dec. 1, 2019, and had no link to the seafood market.
                    Investigations are ongoing as to how this virus originated and spread.

                    <h3>What is the incubation period for COVID-19?</h3>
                    It appears that symptoms are showing up in people within 14 days of exposure to the virus.
                    <h3>How is COVID-19 diagnosed?</h3>
                    Diagnosis may be difficult with only a physical exam because mild cases of COVID-19 may appear
                    similar to the flu or a bad cold. A laboratory test can confirm the diagnosis. Learn more about
                    COVID-19 testing.

                    <h3>How is COVID-19 treated?</h3>
                    As of now, there is not a specific treatment for the virus. People who become sick from COVID-19
                    should be treated with supportive measures: those that relieve symptoms. For severe cases, there may
                    be additional options for treatment, including research drugs and therapeutics.

                    <h3>Does COVID-19 cause death?</h3>
                    As of February 26, 2021, 2,509,666 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19. However, 63,825,823
                    people have recovered from the illness. This information comes from the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global
                    Cases map developed by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
